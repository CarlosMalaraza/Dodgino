# Arduino-Pygame-MySQL Project
## Overview
This project seamlessly integrates Python, Arduino, and MySQL to create an interactive graphical interface using Pygame, with real-time control via Arduino. It's designed to provide an immersive experience, where user interactions are managed through Arduino, and a scoring system is dynamically updated and stored in a MySQL database.

## Components
Arduino Script (C++): This script is responsible for handling the hardware interactions. It reads inputs from the Arduino device and sends the data to the Python script for further processing.

Pygame Interface (Python): The core of the graphical interface, this script utilizes Pygame for rendering visuals and responding to user interactions. It receives data from the Arduino script and updates the game state accordingly.

MySQL Database Integration (Python): This script manages the scoring system. It records scores calculated by the game logic and stores them in a MySQL database, enabling persistent data tracking and possibly leaderboards or historical data analysis.

Sprites and Assets: Essential graphical elements that are used within the Pygame interface to create an engaging visual experience.

## How It Works
The Arduino script captures user inputs and sends them to the Python script.
The Python script processes these inputs, updates the game state, and renders the interface using Pygame.
Scores and other relevant data are computed and then sent to the MySQL database for storage and retrieval.

## Installation & Setup
Set up your Arduino device with the provided C++ script.
Install Python and Pygame on your computer.
Set up a MySQL server and configure it as per the database script.
Run the Python scripts to start the game.

## Usage
Interact with the game via the Arduino controls.
View real-time updates on the Pygame interface.
Check your scores and data stored in the MySQL database.
